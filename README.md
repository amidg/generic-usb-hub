# generic-usb-hub
Generic USB 2.0 hub designed in according to USB 2.0 specifications. Designed to save your precious USB 3.0/3.1 ports from low-speed utilization (e.g. mouse, keyboard etc).

- Type-C input (12-pin)
- Three Type-A 2.0 ports

This circuit can be implemented as a part of any other simple USB2.0 board (e.g. Arduino). This design is used for my micro8051 board as well as PCIe based ROS-platform

P.S. I use this board to save ports on my Intel NUC computer
